A JSON file holds an array of projects which are dynamically served to the client.

Custom error pages are served when a page is not found or if there is a server error.

Image and Github links are not included in the JSON as they are dynamically created in the template using the Github repo name.

Background, text colors were changed on the site and a hover animation was added to each project item on the home page.
